# Assignment 3 - FCB 2020
### Deadline: 23/10/2020 - 23:59

## Submission procedure

This assignment has to be submitted using GitHub Classroom. This
means that you should have cloned the GitHub repo of this assignment from
the organization account for FCB in the academic year 2020-21 at
[https://github.com/funcompbio2020](https://github.com/funcompbio2020)
using the submission link provided at the FCB Moodle site.

Once you have cloned the GitHub repo which has `assignment-3` and your
GitHub username as repo name, then you can work on it in your local disk
and _push_ your changes whenever you like, but make sure that you have pushed
the last version of your assignment before the deadline. There is no
_submit_ button or any other specific submission procedure or action than
just pushing your changes to you GitHub assignment repo. When correcting the
assignment, the version available at the deadline will be retrieved. If the
first version available is posterior to the deadline, then the mark of the
assignment will have a penalty.

## Description

The goal of this assignment is to implement a program in Python that
**asks for a natural number greater than 1 and calculates whether that
number is prime or not, saying 'yes' when the given number is prime and 'no' otherwise**.

According to the Wikipedia [page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number),
a prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a
product of two smaller natural numbers. A natural number greater than 1 that
is not prime is called a composite number. For example, 5 is prime because the
only ways of writing it as a product, 1x5 or 5x1, involve 5 itself. However, 4
is composite because it is a product (2x2) in which both numbers are smaller than 4.

Your assignment repo should have the following two files:

  1. This `README.md` file.
  2. A Python program called `prime.py` implementing the required calculation.

## Evaluation rubric

The rubric to evaluate this assignment consists of the following items:

  * Does the assignment contain the two required files?
  * Does the Python program `prime.py` runs without errors?
  * Does the Python program `prime.py` identifies prime numbers correctly?
